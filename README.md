#### _Shiwu - The soil detection and crop prediction application_

#### Overview

_Our aim is to create a soil detector which detects the soil type based on the image and suggests best crops to grow to promote sustainable agriculture and increase crop production._

Our target audience includes farmers and gardening enthusiasts.
Project Shiwu aims to cover three sustainable development goals - zero hunger, responsible consumption and production and life on land.

We will be deploying our ML model using Flask on our website and users will be able to upload pictures of their soil and get suggestions on which is the best crop for them to grow in there.

#### Technology used

For designing we have used Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and Premier Pro.
For frontend we are using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
For backend we are utilising Flask framework.
For machine learning we are creating a CNN model using Keras and Tensorflow.

#### Screenshots/Demo Video

_We are currently in the designing phase. Attaching the screenshots of the designs we have created below:_
